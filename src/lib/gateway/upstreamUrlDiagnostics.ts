/**
 * Static checks for the upstream gateway URL a user types into the connect UI.
 *
 * Hermes3D speaks its own gateway protocol: the client opens a socket, sends a
 * `connect` frame, and waits for `hello-ok`. Several nearby Hermes endpoints
 * listen on well-known ports but speak something else entirely, so pointing at
 * them can never succeed no matter which credentials are supplied. Catching
 * those here turns a 13s connect timeout into an explanation.
 *
 * `scripts/lib/hermes3doctor-core.mjs` mirrors these rules for the CLI doctor,
 * which runs under plain node and cannot import TypeScript. `tests/unit/
 * upstreamUrlDiagnostics.test.ts` asserts the two stay in agreement.
